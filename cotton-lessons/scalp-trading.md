Scalping is just being aware of where price is going&#x20;

Remember to check if ur still laddering on higher time frames not just scalp time frames, larger time frame ladders are gonna lead to the larger bounces

A scalp is something we have to be extremely aware of cuz we dont know if its gonna fail or go up so we're gonna be in the trade for a very short period of time&#x20;

A scalp is very unknown in terms of what its gonna do, we just catch a knife and were out of it quickly cuz its gonna have a large/quick bounce or ur gonna be buying a trend break and it's gonna have a quick move up
