I wouldn't recommend doing a swing on a knife catch, a swing would be better if you come back and stabilize on a hold level after the inverse. So scalp the knife catch bounce,TP, then swing trade on the final hold

Knife catch scalp to target and short the target and if u come back down and hold the final hold relong the confirmation of the move as a swing but if u break that final hold it turns that short into a swing trade. So 2 scalps and a swing or 1 scalp and 1 swing

Catching a falling knife cannot be a swing trade. That is a scalp

Selling an inverse is a swing that can turn into a scalp if it invalidates

A swing trade can turn into a scalp or a position trade
