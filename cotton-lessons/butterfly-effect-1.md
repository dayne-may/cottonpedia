#### Strong hold level

Strong hold level is going to have a strong reaction, its gonna come down touch the level and have a strong instant reaction afterwards(knife catch scenario,big bounce and/or quick move)

#### Greedy Hold level

Price will go after that level and attempt to continuously hold it over time through a trend. Its the greediest point in the move before the move starts to break, it's the best price before the move completely collapses down

Why do we call it greedy?- it's gonna be the greediest point in the move before the move starts to break the larger piece of what it's representing



A strong level is a backside hold and a greedy level is a frontside hold&#x20;

If the greedy hold cant hold the move its gonna break it down, it becomes the greediest point in the move to try and hold the move up
