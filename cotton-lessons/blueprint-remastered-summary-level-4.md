# ðŸ“˜ Blueprint Remastered Summary (Level 4)

PA (Procedural analysis) - before the trade

RA (Risk analysis) - during the trade

CA (Computation analysis) - after the trade

Once targets are hit, you are back into PA and then RA and CA.



PA (Procedural analysis)

Everything that happens before a trade.

Before you make the decision to enter, you have to consider procedural queue of events

We need to start thinking of trades as Implied odds

Implied odds means how much you could potentially make in any given play given the risk involved



In extremely risky level, you have to do RA the hell out of that level.



Misidentifying Odds

If you are playing a 10/10 level at the bottom of a range to the first bounce, then you're completely misidentifyign the implied trading odds of that trade.



Premium & Non Premium Trades

U also have to start thinking about things in terms of premium and non-premium entries because not every move goes from polarity to polarity and when u see these things like non polarized moments getting targeted and creating polarity on the bottom



It's soo fundamentally wrong to take a position that is soo polarized like an origin level for example, and just say i want to make 2% on it, that would be foolish unless u have a very specific reason



Everytime u enter a trade u have to start thinking about how polarized is this move on the larger scale of things vs this implied trading odd - how far could this thing go down&#x20;

\
The second u enter the trade its where u should start entering that queue of what are my implied trading odds like what makes sense here, for any level- if im taking this trade where does it fundamentally make sense to get out of this trade because having ur exit on that final hold created off your entry doesn't make sense
