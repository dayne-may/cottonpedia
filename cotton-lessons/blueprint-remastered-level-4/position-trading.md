A ton of positions trades open isn't day trading and its not advisable

We need to mark out our larger set of technicals so that we know when to react

Draw the strongest levels on ur chart, be prepared for when it gets hit, and when it happens take your trade appropriately and pick appropriate targets&#x20;

For positions only use coins that r perfectly set up for large breakouts, dont chart ones that already had their breakout\
